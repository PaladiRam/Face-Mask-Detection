# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images. This project is now developed further for detection in real time video streams.

The dataset of the project will be uploaded shortly.
